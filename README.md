So, if you want to know the three kinds of news around the whole world, you have to hit on news.pipilika.com. But why not to make the feature more easy for the general public! That's why I made a chrome extension to show this news in a single click on your browser. If you want the full taste of Pipilika News, there is a link also integrated on the extension page.

## Features
When a user is in **Offline** or **Loading The First Time After Click**, the Extension Page shows the latest **15** news from each category which is saved in **Chrome LocalStorage**. When the user is scrolling to find the new data, if new data available it will show a popup to alert the user about new data arrival. Otherwise, scrolling will reveal new data as before. This extension also notifies the user about internet connection availability.

## Installation

Go to https://github.com/nowshad-hasan/pipilika-news/blob/master/Pipilika%20News.crx and download the Pipilika News.crx file. After that, open up your **Chrome Browser** and go to 
`chrome://extensions/` page. **Drag and Drop** crx file into the `Chrome Extension` page. Or,
check the **Developer Mode**, click on `Load Unpacked Extension` and select the `.crx` file. After loading, unchecked
the `Developer Mode`. Here you go! Click on the **app icon** right side of your `Bookmarks Bar` to see the magic.

## Note
This extension is not officially published yet. So, there may be some bugs or issues. If you face anything like that, please let me know through email `nowshadapu@gmail.com` or `Github`. When it is officially available in **Chrome Store**, I'll give the link here.
